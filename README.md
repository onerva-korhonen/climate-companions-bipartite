# climate-companions-bipartite
Code for investigating the even co-participation based bipartite graph structure in the Ilmastokumppanit (Climate Companions) city-to-business network. Should be applicable also to other bipartite module analyses.

functions.py contains functions needed for creating and analysing the bipartite network. The functions can be called from either a frontend script (an example will be added in future) or interactively.
